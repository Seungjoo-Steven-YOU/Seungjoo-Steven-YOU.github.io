# Seungjoo (Steven) You
*`Data/Research analyst`*

Hi there! My name is Steven, and this is my portfolio containing all the work I have done as an analytics specialist and researcher based in Toronto. All the code that you see on this page are written from the ground up by myself, which includes the preparation, planning, brainstorming, and reporting of all the data related work I have done. 
<br /><br />
**If you are a recruiter/employer, please take a look at my professional projects section.** Feel free to view my personal projects, however be warned: much of the work and ideas will not be as polished as those in my professional portfolio and is mostly my attempts to make my personal life easier. If any of these ideas interest you however, please feel free to check them out!

### Professional Projects! :clipboard:
[Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Who and what makes a Unicorn in North America?](https://github.com/Seungjoo-Steven-YOU/Pale-Horse-Pale-Rider) :carousel_horse:
- 
- *Note: Much of the edits that were made on this project were conducted through a private repository, and this is simply the final product. The HTML file is a self-contained jupyter notebook report*
- Using an available real world startup big data set, my research proved the economic significance that factors such as network size and quality and number of milestones impact the success of a startup company, controlling for various fixed effects.
- This project utilized GeoPandas to visualize the geographic trends in startups as well as using web scraping, text analysis tools, and machine learning such as random forest and regression trees to extract vital trends that can predict startup success.
- Observations in dataset numbered in 565,289; after cleaning, the results contained 22,700 observations.
- Further analysis with result in identification of 20 predictive variables and series of models offer to evaluate the success of startups, which raised accuracy level up to 67.6%, vs previous benchmark of 63.27%.

[Coordinate based Inventory Management System](https://github.com/Seungjoo-Steven-YOU/Coordinate-based-Inventory-Management-System-) :world_map:
-
Prior to the Coordinate based Inventory Management System, a middle sized Canadian retail brand primarily relied on their sales and operations team to simultaneously organize the inventory after shipment as well as make sales to customers ordering items in-store or online. This lead to longer wait times for customers during major shipment dates and longer shifts for the employees responsible for oganization in the immediate, costing our operation. From my own assessment, I recognized that this issue was partly responsible for issues that arose during auditing, item retrieval, and onboarding new employees, in addition to lowering some of the KPIs that I have been tracking for the store, such as sales per square foot, employee turnover rate, and inventory movement. With the management team having some ambitions to turn their retail brand into a franchise across Toronto, I recognized that actionable results were necessary to facilitate this, but most importantly scalability for the existing store was critical to allow for sustainable and smooth growth. 

In this section, I will be going into some detail about the needs and objectives that needed to be met by the sales and strategic planning team, and how I used Python and Excel to develop a full-stack project. To briefly summarize, I wanted each product in our store to be assigned a three dimensional coordinate that directs each item into a specific bin or cubby on our shelves. Each coordinate remains fixed in place, however the placecment of each item may change depending on the incoming shipment. One objective I hope to achiev with this three dimensional coordinate is allowing both seasoned and in-training sales team members to know the exact location of every product. Once properly trained on this system, the sales team should be able to locate the coordinate of items to the exact position they are at the store, while being both flexible and scalable; the system avoids concreteness and should be abstract enough that it can easily be adjusted to accomodate any changes in product organization desired by the sales team as well as accomodating a potentially greater quantity of product shipment or a new store layout at a different location that is highly desireable for the strategic planning and management team. As my role as a lead analyst, this is probably **the most ambitious professional project that I have tried to build from scratch!**

***Disclaimer: This section only provides the final python application that uses a previously prepared and cleaned excel workbook. I will not be providing any information that could effect the planning of my employer nor am I providing any information that is privileged. However, feel free to use the coordinate based management system to improve your own retail processes!***

As I'm writing this description, the store wide trial runs and implementation process is underway, so expect more updates to come in the near future! At the moment, this is the most bare bones product and the project is far from over. I hope to show progress using Version Control on Github, but I hope to be able to show the preliminary results and the subsequent improvements in our tracked KPIs as a result of this new system. 

### Personal projects! :house:
### [Automating my life away!](https://github.com/Seungjoo-Steven-YOU/automate_away) :dart:
This is a personal project that contains some of my attempts to automate my own life. Whether that's a way to automate much of my job application process or finances, automating my life has become a huge focus of mine in the past few months. I will take a journaling approach for these projects through some blogs. I hope others can use these blogs to improve some of the boring aspects of their own lives!
